This repository contains three sample problems I completed for my application to be an intern at Aporeto.

Problem 1: 
"This is a shell program that creates a file that has all 50 states listed in it. Each state is on its own line and is sorted in alphabetical order. The name of the file is the first argument the user input.

options:
	-h or —-help  will tell you what the program does and how to use it
	—-no-prompt   this option will overwrite the filename you put without alerting you if it exists or not
	—verbose      this option will print out extra documentation for when the file is removed, created and already exists\n

The usage format is 
sh test1.sh [--help|-h]
sh test1.sh <filename> [--no-prompt] [--verbose] \n

A sample for how it may look in terminal is:

	sh test1.sh file.txt --no-prompt --verbose\n"
